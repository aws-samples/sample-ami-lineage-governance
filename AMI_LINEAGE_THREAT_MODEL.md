# AMI Lineage Governance Solution Threat Model

**Solution Name:** AMI Lineage Governance Framework

## 1. What are we building?

A multi-account AWS solution that tracks and enforces compliance for Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) across an organization. The solution includes:

- **Amazon Neptune** for graph-based AMI lineage tracking
- **AWS Lambda functions** for event processing and compliance evaluation
- **Amazon API Gateway** for secure API access to lineage data
- **AWS EventBridge** for capturing AMI lifecycle events across accounts
- **AWS Config Rules** for continuous compliance monitoring
- **AWS Security Hub** for centralized security findings
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** for organizational governance enforcement
- **Amazon SNS** for notifications and alerts
- **Amazon S3** for configuration storage and audit logs

## 2. What can go wrong?

### 1. Authentication and Authorization Issues:
- Unauthorized access to AMI lineage data through compromised cross-account roles
- API Gateway authentication bypass allowing unauthorized data access
- Excessive Lambda function permissions leading to privilege escalation
- Weak cross-account trust relationships enabling unauthorized access

### 2. Data Security Concerns:
- Sensitive AMI metadata exposed through unencrypted Neptune database
- AMI lineage data manipulation to bypass compliance checks
- Cross-account data leakage through misconfigured permissions
- Audit trail tampering or deletion to hide non-compliant activities

### 3. API and Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:
- Injection attacks against Neptune through API inputs
- Denial of Service attacks against API Gateway endpoints
- Lambda function vulnerabilities through dependency exploits
- Insufficient input validation leading to data corruption

### 4. AMI Governance Bypass:
- False AMI lineage creation to circumvent compliance policies
- SCP policy manipulation or bypass techniques
- Alternative AMI deployment methods not monitored by the solution
- Unauthorized AMI approval through workflow manipulation

### 5. Operational Risks:
- Inadequate logging allowing security events to go undetected
- Service disruption through resource exhaustion attacks
- Configuration drift weakening security controls
- Lack of proper incident response for AMI governance violations

## 3. What are we going to do about it?

### 1. Authentication and Authorization Improvements:
- Implement external IDs and condition-based policies for cross-account access
- Deploy AWS WAF for API Gateway protection with rate limiting
- Apply least privilege IAM permissions and eliminate wildcard policies
- Require MFA for sensitive administrative operations

### 2. Data Security Enhancements:
- Enable encryption at rest for Neptune, S3, and CloudWatch Logs
- Use customer-managed KMS keys for sensitive data encryption
- Deploy Neptune in VPC with private subnets and security groups
- Implement S3 Object Lock for immutable audit trails

### 3. API and Infrastructure Security:
- Add comprehensive input validation for all API endpoints
- Implement query validation to prevent Neptune injection attacks
- Regular dependency scanning and updates for Lambda functions
- Set appropriate resource limits and timeouts for all functions

### 4. AMI Governance Controls:
- Cross-validate lineage data from multiple sources (CloudTrail, Config, EventBridge)
- Implement comprehensive SCPs to prevent governance bypass
- Monitor Config rule compliance and prevent unauthorized changes
- Require multi-person authorization for critical AMI operations

### 5. Operational Security:
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring with CloudWatch
- Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activities and compliance violations
- Create automated incident response procedures
- Establish regular security assessments and penetration testing

## 4. Did we do a good job?

The current implementation provides a solid security foundation with several controls in place:

### 1. Strong Points:
- Multi-account architecture with proper separation of concerns
- IAM roles follow least privilege principles with dedicated service roles
- Neptune database deployed in VPC with encryption enabled
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring across all components
- Integration with AWS security services (Security Hub, Config, CloudTrail)
- Service Control Policies implemented for organizational governance

### 2. Areas for Improvement:
- Enhance input validation for all Lambda functions
- Add behavioral analytics for anomaly detection
- Implement customer-managed KMS keys across all services
- Add comprehensive error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### 3. Next Steps:
- Deploy AWS WAF for API Gateway protection
- Implement MFA for administrative operations
- Conduct comprehensive access review and cleanup
- Add automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Create detailed incident response playbooks
- Implement regular security training for operations teams
- Add continuous compliance monitoring with automated remediation

The solution implements strong security controls following AWS best practices, but security requires continuous improvement. Regular assessments and updates should be conducted as the solution evolves and new threats emerge.
