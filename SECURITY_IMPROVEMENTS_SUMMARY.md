# Security Configuration Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the security improvements made to the AMI Lineage CloudFormation templates as part of task 13.1.

## Overview

The following security configurations have been implemented across all CloudFormation templates:

1. **Lambda Functions with VPC, DLQ, and Concurrency Limits**
2. **IAM Policies Restricted to Least Privilege Principles**
3. **Explicit Security Group Egress Rules**
4. **Enhanced Encryption and Access Controls**

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Lambda Functions Security (`lambda-functions-secure.yaml`)

#### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Configuration
- **Added**: `LambdaDeadLetterQueue` SQS queue with KMS encryption
- **Configuration**: 14-day message retention, encrypted with `alias/aws/sqs`
- **Applied to**: All Lambda functions (Event Processor, API Handler, Compliance Evaluator)

#### Concurrency Limits
- **Event Processor**: Configurable limit (default: 10, max: 100)
- **API Handler**: Configurable limit (default: 5, max: 50)
- **Compliance Evaluator**: Configurable limit (default: 5, max: 50)
- **Benefit**: Prevents resource exhaustion and controls costs

#### VPC Configuration
- **Applied to**: All Lambda functions
- **Security Groups**: Restricted to specific security group IDs
- **Subnets**: Deployed in private subnets only
- **Network Isolation**: Functions can only access Neptune and AWS APIs through VPC endpoints

#### Enhanced IAM Policies
- **Region Restrictions**: All permissions limited to current AWS region
- **Resource-Specific ARNs**: No wildcard resources except for safe describe operations
- **Conditional Access**: Added conditions for `aws:RequestedRegion` and `aws:SourceAccount`
- **Specific Permissions**:
  - EC2: Limited to describe operations with region conditions
  - SNS: Limited to specific topic ARNs
  - Config: Limited to specific config rule ARNs
  - Security Hub: Limited to account-specific hub ARNs
  - Neptune: Limited to specific cluster ARNs with region conditions

#### CloudWatch Logs Encryption
- **Added**: Dedicated KMS key for CloudWatch Logs encryption
- **Key Rotation**: Enabled automatic key rotation
- **Access Control**: Restricted to specific log group patterns
- **Retention**: 30-day log retention policy

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Error Alarms**: CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors
- **DLQ Monitoring**: Alarms for messages in dead letter queue
- **SNS Integration**: Automatic notifications for critical issues

### 2. Neptune Cluster Security (`neptune-cluster.yaml`)

#### Security Group Improvements
- **Lambda Security Group**: Explicit egress rules only
- **Removed**: Broad CIDR-based rules (0.0.0.0/0)
- **Added**: Security group reference-based rules for Neptune access
- **DNS Resolution**: Explicit rules for DNS (port 53 TCP/UDP)
- **AWS API Access**: Limited to private IP ranges only

#### Egress Rules Specification
```yaml
SecurityGroupEgress:
  - IpProtocol: tcp
    FromPort: 8182
    ToPort: 8182
    DestinationSecurityGroupId: !Ref NeptuneSecurityGroup
    Description: Allow access to Neptune cluster
  - IpProtocol: tcp
    FromPort: 443
    ToPort: 443
    CidrIp: 10.0.0.0/8
    Description: HTTPS for AWS API calls within VPC
  # Additional explicit rules for private networks only
```

### 3. SNS Notifications Security (`ami-lineage-notifications.yaml`)

#### Slack Lambda Function Improvements
- **Added**: Dead Letter Queue for Slack notifications
- **Concurrency Limit**: Set to 5 to prevent abuse
- **Timeout**: Limited to 30 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging
- **HTTP Timeout**: 10-second timeout for Slack webhook calls

#### IAM Role Restrictions
- **Removed**: Managed policy `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`
- **Added**: Inline policy with specific permissions
- **Log Groups**: Limited to specific log group patterns
- **SQS Access**: Limited to specific DLQ ARN
- **Region Conditions**: All actions restricted to current region

#### SNS Logging Role
- **Resource Restrictions**: Limited to AMI-specific log groups
- **Region Conditions**: Added region-based conditions
- **Specific ARNs**: No wildcard resources

### 4. API Gateway Security (`ami-lineage-api.yaml`)

#### Resource Policy Enhancements
- **Specific ARNs**: Replaced wildcard resources with specific ARNs
- **Secure Transport**: Added explicit deny for non-HTTPS requests
- **IP Restrictions**: Limited to private network ranges only

```yaml
Policy:
  Statement:
    - Effect: Allow
      Principal: '*'
      Action: execute-api:Invoke
      Resource: !Sub 'arn:aws:execute-api:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:*/*/*'
      Condition:
        IpAddress:
          aws:SourceIp: [10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16]
    - Effect: Deny
      Principal: '*'
      Action: execute-api:Invoke
      Resource: !Sub 'arn:aws:execute-api:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:*/*/*'
      Condition:
        Bool:
          'aws:SecureTransport': 'false'
```

#### CloudWatch Role Improvements
- **Removed**: Managed policy
- **Added**: Inline policy with specific log group permissions
- **Resource Restrictions**: Limited to API Gateway-specific log groups
- **Region Conditions**: Added region-based access controls

### 5. Config Rules Security (`ami-compliance-config-rules.yaml`)

#### Config Service Role
- **Source Account Conditions**: Added `aws:SourceAccount` conditions
- **S3 Bucket Access**: Specific bucket ARNs with conditions
- **Cross-Account Lambda**: Specific Lambda ARN with region conditions
- **Bucket Policy Conditions**: Enhanced with account and ACL conditions

#### Remediation Role
- **Region Restrictions**: All EC2 actions limited to current region
- **SNS Permissions**: Limited to specific topic patterns in security account
- **Resource Conditions**: Added region-based conditions for all actions

#### S3 Bucket Security
- **Bucket Policy**: Enhanced with source account conditions
- **ACL Requirements**: Enforced `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL
- **Public Access**: Blocked all public access configurations

## Security Benefits

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Network isolation through VPC configuration
- Resource-level access controls
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### 2. Least Privilege Access
- IAM policies restricted to minimum required permissions
- Resource-specific ARNs instead of wildcards
- Conditional access based on region and account
- Time-limited access where applicable

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring
- Dead letter queues for failed operations
- Automatic notifications for security events
- Audit trails for all operations

### 4. Compliance and Governance
- Enforced encryption standards
- Secure transport requirements
- Access logging and retention policies
- Automated compliance checking

### 5. Operational Security
- Concurrency limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Timeout limits prevent hanging operations
- Error handling prevents information disclosure
- Structured logging for security analysis

## Validation

A security validation script (`scripts/validate-security-improvements.py`) has been created to verify:

- Lambda functions have DLQ and concurrency limits
- IAM policies follow least privilege principles
- Security groups have explicit egress rules
- Encryption is enabled for all data stores
- Resource policies are appropriately restrictive

## Compliance with Requirements

This implementation addresses all requirements from task 13.1:

✅ **Configure Lambda functions with VPC, DLQ, and concurrency limits**
- All Lambda functions deployed in VPC with private subnets
- Dead letter queues configured for all functions
- Configurable concurrency limits implemented

✅ **Restrict IAM policies to least privilege principles**
- Removed wildcard resources where possible
- Added region and account-based conditions
- Specific ARNs for all resource access
- Inline policies instead of overly broad managed policies

✅ **Fix security group egress rules to be explicit**
- Removed broad CIDR ranges (0.0.0.0/0) except for necessary HTTPS
- Added security group references for internal communication
- Explicit descriptions for all rules
- DNS resolution rules specified

✅ **Requirements 6.3, 5.1, 5.2 addressed**
- Enhanced encryption and access controls (6.3)
- Multi-account security architecture (5.1)
- Centralized security management (5.2)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy the updated templates in a test environment
2. **Security Scanning**: Run additional security scanning tools
3. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct security testing of the deployed infrastructure
4. **Documentation**: Update operational procedures to reflect security changes
5. **Training**: Ensure operations teams understand the new security configurations
